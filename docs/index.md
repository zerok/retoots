# retoots!

A lightweight service for fetching comments to a particular Mastdodon status
and showing them as comments on, for instance, a static website.

While one could directly fetch the mentions via the Mastodon API within the
user's browser, I wanted to have some more control over what comments are shown
on my website and therefore have a layer between the blog and the upstream
Mastodon server.
